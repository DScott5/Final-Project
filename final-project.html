<h1 class="coke-zero-title" id="CZ"><u>Coke Zero Sugar</u></h1>
<img class="coke-image" src="https://github.com/DScott5/Final-Project/blob/master/IMG/CokeZeroSugar.jpg?raw=true">
<p class="coke-desc">Coke has done a phenomenal job improving the taste of Coke Zero,<br>
making it much more palatable. The harsh zero calorie taste from the original formula<br>
has been completely removed, giving a much more crisp finish. This new forumla helps<br>
give the feeling of drinking regular coke while still containing zero calories.<br>

<h1 class="snapple-title" id="SP"><u>Snapple Fruit Punch</u></h1>
<img class="snapple-image" src="https://github.com/DScott5/Final-Project/blob/master/IMG/SnappleFruitPunch.jpg?raw=true">
<p class="snapple-desc">Snapple has brought us an interesting take on the classic beverage.<br>
Surprisingly this was very good, and never felt too sweet because it's not<br>
sweetened with corn syrup, just regular old sugar.<br>

<h1 class="bubly-title" id="BB"><u>Strawberry Bubly</u></h1>
<img class="bubly-image" src="https://github.com/DScott5/Final-Project/blob/master/IMG/StrawberryBubly.jpg?raw=true">
<p class="bubly-desc">I'm interested to see what this new brand of seltzer has to offer since<br>
I'm quite the seltzer connoisseur. This particular flavor has a very fresh from the field<br>
strawberry taste that I've never tasted in carbonated form which was very impressive.<br>

<h1 class="vitamin-title" id="VW"><u>Vitamin Water Breeze-E</u></h1>
<img class="vitamin-image" src="https://github.com/DScott5/Final-Project/blob/master/IMG/VitaminWaterBreeze-E.jpg?raw=true">
<p class="vitamin-desc">This beverage was a real doozy for me. I could hardly taste the
watermelon<br>and had a tough time picking out the strawberry. It's like it wasn't even there
to begin with.<br>

<h1 class="canada-title" id="CD"><u>Canada Dry Lemonade</u></h1>
<img class="canada-image" src="https://github.com/DScott5/Final-Project/blob/master/IMG/CanadaDryLemonade.jpg?raw=true">
<p class="canada-desc">Canada Dry Lemonade is a very ambitious take on the ginger ale.<br>
It's quite good but the ginger ale slightly overpowers the lemonade<br>making you have to really
hunt for the flavor while you sip it.<br>

<div class="content">
<p>Overall Coke Zero Sugar blew all these drinks out of the water for me. It was the first drink
I tried out of the bunch and the revision to the formula was very much needed in my eyes.<br><br>
The weakest drink for me was the Vitamin Water Breeze-e because the taste was very faint
and hardly even there.
